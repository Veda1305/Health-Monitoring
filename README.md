# Health Monitoring System using Arduino and GSM Module
So, for people who are staying in remote areas have a diffculty of having check-up of their health everytime because they have to spend lot of money, time and effort to make that happen as they have to go to nearby cities or villages where they have the hospitals. So, in this project we are creating a prototype such that they can have their health check-ups at the place where they are staying itself from the doctors whom they want to access.
This project is used to monitor and track a person's health in real-time. This system consists of an Arduino microcontroller board, a GSM module for wireless communication, a heart sensor to measure the user's, and a sensor to measure the's body temperature. The heart rate sensor is connected to the Arduino board and measures the user's heart rate by detecting the pulse in their fingertip. The temperature sensor is also connected to the Arduino board and measures the user's body temperature.
The Arduino board is programmed to read the data from the sensors and process it to calculate the user's heart rate and body temperature. The GSM module is used to transmit the data wirelessly to a remote location, such as a doctor's office or a hospital. The data is sent through SMS messages or through a web interface, allowing healthcare professionals to monitor the user's health in real-time. The system can also be configured to send alerts or notifications if the user's heart rate or body temperature falls outside of a predetermined range.
Overall, this project is a valuable tool for monitoring and managing a person's health, especially for those who have chronic health conditions or are at risk of medical emergencies or for the people who are staying in remote areas. It provides a convenient and non-invasive way to monitor vital signs and ensures that healthcare professionals can respond quickly to any changes in the user's health.
